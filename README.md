# kalamari
A scripting language to finally provide a simple, digital tablature-writing solution.



  DIRECTIONS:
  
   1. unzip the Kalamari.app.zip file
   2. if you get an unidentified developer error go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and click "Open Anyway"
   3. once the app is open a Source and Tabs window will be displayed. You write all source in the Source window and click Build > Compile to compile the source and get the output tabs
   4. You can save or open files from the edit menu
   
   
   
   SCRIPTING LANGUAGE:
   
   _ The notation 2;1 corresponds to the first fret on the second string.
   
   _ 5;3s5 corresponds to a slide from the 3rd fret to the 5th, on the 5th string.
   
   _ 1,2,3,4,5;0,1,2,2,0,0 corresponds to a chord (Am)
   
   _ Tabs are fully editable once saved, but recompiling will override all changes made directly in the Tabs window
